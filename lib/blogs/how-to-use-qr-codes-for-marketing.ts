In an increasingly digital world, small businesses are constantly looking for ways to stand out. QR codes offer a low-cost, high-impact solution to bridge the gap between offline advertising and online sales. 

## 1. Interactive Business Cards
Traditional business cards often end up in the trash because they are a hassle to manually type into a phone. By adding a vCard QR code generated on FreeQR, you allow potential clients to save your contact details—including your phone number, email, and LinkedIn profile—with a single scan.

## 2. 'Scan to Win' Contests
Engagement is the key to brand loyalty. You can place QR codes on posters or flyers that lead directly to a signup form for a giveaway. This not only drives traffic to your site but also helps you build a valuable email marketing list.

## 3. Digital Menus and Catalogs
For restaurants and retail stores, QR codes are a game changer. Instead of printing expensive seasonal menus, simply link a QR code to a PDF or a responsive webpage. This allows you to update prices and items in real-time without spending a cent on reprinting.

## 4. Boost Social Media Following
Want more Instagram or TikTok followers? Place a QR code near your checkout counter with a Call to Action (CTA) like "Scan to follow us for daily deals." It’s much faster than asking a customer to search for your handle.

## 5. App Store Downloads
If your business has a mobile app, use a QR code on your storefront window. It removes the friction of searching the App Store or Play Store, leading to higher conversion rates for app installs.

## 6. Real Estate Virtual Tours
Real estate agents can place QR codes on 'For Sale' signs. When scanned, the buyer is instantly taken to a 360-degree virtual tour or a high-resolution image gallery of the property, providing immediate value.

## 7. Direct Feedback and Reviews
Google Reviews are critical for local SEO. You can generate a QR code that links directly to your Google 'Write a Review' page. Hand these out on small cards with every purchase to significantly increase your 5-star ratings.

## Best Practices for Marketing QR Codes
- **Always provide a reason to scan:** Use text like "Scan for 10% off" instead of a lonely code.
- **Test the landing page:** Ensure the link is mobile-friendly, as 100% of your scanners will be using a smartphone.
- **Size and Placement:** Ensure the code is at least 2cm x 2cm and placed at eye level.
