QR codes have become an essential part of our digital ecosystem, connecting physical objects to digital information instantly. Whether you are a business owner or a student, knowing how to create a high-quality QR code is a valuable skill. In this guide, we will walk you through the professional process using FreeQR.

## Why Use a QR Code?
Before we dive into the 'how,' it is important to understand the 'why.' QR codes (Quick Response codes) can store a variety of data types, from simple website links to complex WiFi credentials. They eliminate the need for manual typing, reduce human error, and provide a seamless user experience.

## Step 1: Select the Right QR Code Type
The first step is identifying what data you want to share. On the FreeQR dashboard, you will find several options:
- **URL:** Best for linking to websites, social media profiles, or online portfolios.
- **WiFi:** Allows guests to scan and connect to your internet without seeing your password.
- **UPI:** Perfect for accepting digital payments directly into your bank account.
- **WhatsApp/Email:** Triggers a pre-filled message to your contact number or inbox.

## Step 2: Input Your Information
Once you have selected your type, enter the details carefully. 
- For a **URL**, ensure you include the 'https://' prefix for maximum compatibility. 
- For **WiFi**, double-check the SSID (Network Name) and encryption type (WPA/WPA2 is the most common). 
Because FreeQR is a privacy-first tool, this data is processed locally in your browser and is never stored on our servers.

## Step 3: Customization for Branding
A black-and-white QR code works, but a customized one builds brand trust. On FreeQR, you can:
- **Adjust Colors:** Choose a foreground color that matches your brand palette. 
- **Ensure Contrast:** Always maintain a high contrast between the code and the background (e.g., dark blue on white) to ensure scanners can read it easily.
- **Size Selection:** Choose a larger pixel size if you plan to print the code on a large banner or poster.

## Step 4: Choose the Best Download Format
FreeQR offers three professional formats for your needs:
1. **PNG:** Ideal for web use, social media, and digital documents.
2. **SVG:** A vector format that can be scaled to any size without losing quality—best for professional printing and large-scale signage.
3. **PDF:** Great for sharing directly or printing at home.

## Final Checklist Before Printing
Always test your QR code with multiple devices (both iOS and Android) before printing it on hundreds of flyers or business cards. Ensure the lighting is good and the code is not too small to be detected by a standard smartphone camera.
