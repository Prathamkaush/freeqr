Creating a UPI QR code is one of the easiest ways to accept digital payments in India.
With a single QR code, customers can pay you instantly using Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, or BHIM.

In this guide, we’ll explain **what a UPI QR code is**, **how it works**, and **how you can create one for free** using FreeQR.

## What is a UPI QR code?

A UPI QR code is a scannable code that contains your UPI payment details.
When someone scans the QR code using a UPI app, the payment screen opens automatically with your UPI ID filled in.

UPI QR codes are commonly used by:
- Shops and retail stores
- Street vendors
- Freelancers
- Restaurants and cafés
- Online sellers

## What do you need to create a UPI QR code?

To generate a UPI QR code, you only need:
- A valid UPI ID (for example: name@upi, mobile@okaxis)
- A payee name (your name or business name)

Optional details:
- Fixed payment amount
- Payment note or purpose

## Step-by-step: How to create a UPI QR code

Follow these simple steps to create your UPI QR code using FreeQR:

## Step 1: Open the FreeQR UPI QR generator
Go to the FreeQR homepage and select the **UPI** option from the QR type list.

## Step 2: Enter your UPI ID
Type your valid UPI ID, such as name@upi or shopname@paytm.
Make sure there are no spaces or spelling mistakes.

## Step 3: Enter your payee name
Add your name or business name. This helps customers verify who they are paying.

## Step 4: (Optional) Add amount and note
You can set a fixed amount or leave it empty so customers can enter the amount themselves.
You may also add a short note like “Payment for services”.

## Step 5: Generate and download the QR code
Once your details are valid, the QR code will appear instantly.
You can download it in PNG, SVG, or PDF format.

## Do UPI QR codes expire?

No. UPI QR codes do **not expire**.
As long as your UPI ID remains active, the QR code will continue to work.

## Is it safe to use a UPI QR code?

Yes. UPI QR codes are safe because:
- Payments are handled by official UPI apps
- FreeQR does not store your UPI ID or transaction data
- No payment is processed on the website itself

UPI QR codes are widely used for business payments across India.
You can print your QR code, share it digitally, or display it at your shop.
